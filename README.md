# Covid-19-Outbreak-Modelling
This repository is for all of my notebooks related to modeling the Covid-19 outbreak. Aims of modeling include determining what R-naught levels are optimal for cost and lives saved, evaluating policies such as mandatory self-isolation or only elderly isolation and understanding how the outbreak might progress.
